## Motivation
For individuals missing a hand or part of their upper limb, there is a severe lack of prosthetic solutions for swinging a golf club with proper form. The leading product on the market results in poor swing mechanics and discomfort to the user.

## Objective
To develop the first prosthetic golf attachment with a wrist joint to simulate the trailing wrist and hand, giving golfers with disabilities more control and power over their swing.
