title:  "Senior Capstone: Prosthetic Golf Attachment"

## Motivation
For individuals missing a hand or part of their upper limb, there is a severe lack of prosthetic solutions for swinging a golf club with proper form. The leading product on the market results in poor swing mechanics and discomfort to the user.

## Objective
To develop the first prosthetic golf attachment with a wrist joint to simulate the trailing wrist and hand, giving golfers with disabilities more control and power over their swing.

## Project Details
This project involved a multidisciplinary design approach. Swing mechanics were evaluated using physics based numerical models as well as empirical models developed from acquired motion capture data. The team collaborated with students in the College of Kinesiology to use a state of the art infrared motion capture system to acquire data of the kinematics during a golf swing. The team then used this data to determine the required degrees of freedom needed to emulate the trailing wrist in a golf swing. The team also collaborated with Advance Digital Design and Fabrication Lab to iteratively designed and fabricate 3D printed prototypes of the attachement. The final attachment was fabricated using fiberglass reinforced Nylon-12 and a custom steel bolt (both 3D printed). Qualitive analysis between the final design, the golf attachment by TRS, and no prosthetic attachemnt confirmed the viability of the design.
